## You typed Aura.xlsl. Likely you meant Aura.xlsx (Excel workbook).

    |typi.xlsl is not a valid Microsoft Excel extension| |Excel only recognizes formats like|

	•	.xlsx → Standard workbook
	•	.xls → Legacy workbook (Excel 97–2003)
	•	.xlsm → Workbook with macros
	•	.csv → Comma-separated values
